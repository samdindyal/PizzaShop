# Pizzeria

In order to learn iOS development I have decided to remake old assignments from the first time I learned programming. The purpose of this assignment was to calculate the cost of a pizza as follows:

- [x] Labour cost is $0.75, regardless of size
- [x] Rent cost is $1.00 per pizza, regardless of size
- [x] Materials cost = diameterÂ²

I have used segues, along with orders capable of containing mulitple pizzas, to provide a user interface that allows the user to create and edit multiple orders and pizzas. I have also used custom UITableViewCell objects to display the data of orders and pizzas more effectively.
